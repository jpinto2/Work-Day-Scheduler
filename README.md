An hourly scheduler for the day that lists each activity

The purpose was to use our newfound knowledge from our lectures to create a hourly planner for the day where you can enter in a task for each hour and have it persist in local storage. The planner is also color coded for each hour in regards to whether the hour is in past, present, or future
